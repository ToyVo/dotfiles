# Dotfile management handled via nix and home-manager

## Systems I have configured
 - Nix Darwin on my Macbook Pro
 - Nix Darwin on my Work Macbook Pro, which is the reason git-crypt is setup to hide some potentially sensitive data
 - NixOs on several laptops
 - NixOs on several raspberry pis
 - NixOs on Steam Deck
 - Pinebook Pro

## TODO:
 - HP ARM Laptop, I've been unable to get linux running on this so try WSL
 - 2 BTT CB1, klipper on nix?
