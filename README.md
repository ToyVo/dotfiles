# Dotfile management handled via nix and home-manager

## Systems I have configured
 - Nix Darwin on my Macbook Pro
 - Nix Darwin on my Work Macbook Pro, which is the reason git-crypt is setup to hide some potentially sensitive data
 - Nix Os on my Thinkpad
 - Nix Os on one of my Raspberry Pis
 - Home Manager on my Steam Deck


## TODO:
 - HP Z Book
 - HP Envy
 - HP ARM Laptop, I've been unable to get linux running on this so try WSL
 - 3 Other Raspberry Pis
 - Pinebook Pro
 - 2 BTT CB1, klipper on nix?
